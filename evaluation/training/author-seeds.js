 * ~half the time, and its judge rejects genuine variants — see
 * generate-training.js for the automated pipeline and its lessons. The
 * original adversarial corpus was also human-curated for the same reason.
 *
 * Run: node evaluation/training/author-seeds.js   → writes train-seeds.json
 * The existing corpora stay HELD-OUT evaluation; nothing here is benchmarked.
