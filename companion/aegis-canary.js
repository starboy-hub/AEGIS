/**
 * AEGIS Voice Canary — companion tool (Phase 4)
 *
 * The anti-deepfake core, usable today without any audio processing:
 * cloned voices cannot answer random personal challenges that were never
 * public. Before trusting an urgent "family member" call, generate a
 * challenge and ask it — a real person answers; a clone stonewalls,
 * deflects, or hangs up.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node companion/aegis-canary.js                     # generic challenge
 *   node companion/aegis-canary.js --config=~/.aegis/canary.json
 *
 * Config file (optional): { "personals": ["the name of our first dog", ...] }
 * Rules of use are printed with every challenge.
